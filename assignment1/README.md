Im Ryan, a computer engineering major

I have been fascinated by the power of the internet and technology since I was in grade school
Lately I have been drawn into the world of music and how it can be applied into the world of technology.
I have shifted my studies from the study of code, to graphic anf visual design for electronic artist.
The ablity to display an artist persona through images, shapes, colors and lack of colors has
lots of complexity that creates a challenge that I would love to tackle.

I'm a local boy from Broomfield, Colorado
On my spare time I find myself trail running and hiking, as well as working with clients
as a personal trainer.
