    <h1>Dive into my life!</h1>
  <p> Hi, my name is Ryan. My pronouns are he/him. Over the course of this semester I hope
    to learn more through my vocabulary about technology in general. I think understanding 
    the power of web development is not only useful information to know but when it comes to 
    advertising means, this can be very helpful and crucial when it comes to something that 
    is functional as well as aestetically pleasing.</p>
