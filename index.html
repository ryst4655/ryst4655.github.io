      <h1>Why are you here?</h1>
      <p>The space and capacity of the human body is an amazing thing. I have spent my time here studying at CU developing
      visuals for electronic artist. I have began to pick up on things that make the brain feel a certain way or even make ones
      body twitch or feel a differnt certain way.
      </p>
      <p>I want to share how I have taught myself and through journeys and digging, to find in particular some things that 
          seem to commomly flash across our eyes and our bodies react to them but we may or may not be quite sure as to why we are seeing
          or feeling these ways.
