        <p>Over the years we have began to pick apart the brain more and more and slowly understand whats beneath our cranium</p>
        <p>Deception is the act of causing someone to accept as true or valid what is false or invalid : <br>the act of deceiving resorting to falsehood and 
        deception used deception to leak the classified information.</p> 
        <p>Deception occurs when you deceive, a word that comes from the Latin de- meaning "from" and capere, meaning "to take."
             When you deceive someone, the result may be taking â€” like items you don't really need from people willing to give them,
              believing they are helping you. You may have heard the phrase "take someone for a ride." That's a way of describing deception.</p>
            <br>
              <p>Deception can have a physical effect on the body. It can cause an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, as well as an increase in 
                the levels of stress hormones such as cortisol. These physical changes can be caused by the anxiety and fear associated with being deceptive, 
                as well as the cognitive effort required to maintain a lie. In some cases, deception can also lead to symptoms of physical illness, such as 
                stomachaches or headaches. Additionally, the long-term effects of chronic deception on the body are not well understood, but it is likely that 
                they can be harmful to physical and mental health.</p>

                <p>Deception of people around us can have many negative effects. It can damage relationships, trust, and communication. When someone is deceived by 
                  someone they care about, they may feel hurt, betrayed, and angry. This can lead to a breakdown in the relationship and make it difficult to rebuild trust. 
                  Deception can also create a sense of disconnection and isolation, as the person who has been deceived may feel like they cannot trust anyone around them.
                   Additionally, deception can cause conflict and misunderstandings, as people may act on false information or beliefs. In general, deception can have serious negative consequences
                  for both the person who is deceived and the person who does the deceiving.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Deception and trust are closely connected. Trust is based on the belief that someone is honest, reliable, and truthful. When someone is deceptive, they violate this trust and 
                    create doubt about their honesty and reliability. As a result, deception can damage trust in a relationship and make it difficult to rebuild. In order to restore trust after deception, 
                    the person who was deceptive must take responsibility for their actions and be willing to make amends. This can involve apologizing, explaining the reasons for the deception, and taking 
                    steps to prevent future deception. It may also be necessary for the person who was deceived to work through their feelings of hurt and betrayal in order to forgive and move forward.</p>
