        <h1>Picking apart the brain</h1>
        <p><br>  It is believed that our concious mind is only made up of 10% of our brain. Which leads us to the 
            question of that other 90% of potential or powers that we withhold within our heads. When we talk about
            our concious minds we dig into those everyday decisions and choices that we make. As this has been studied
            through an interactionist mindset. 
        </p>
        <p>     Seeing the world in an interactionist way is important as it displays the direct connection between the things and events that we see and witness,
             as they do in fact have a relationship to the physical events that we experience as well.<br> We can see this chain of events through interactionism, as the 
             thought of doing something and figuring </p><p> how it will play out will soon lead to giving the body signals to complete this task on the physical side. As we can see examples
              of this when celebrities or idols give motivation to in fact make change in this world, the powerful words that they spread to the millions of people watching their words and actions usually drive motivation 
              to go out and make positive changes one small step at a time.<br> This process of cause and effect is the foundation behind interactionism. This theory is important to explain how this world is constantly changing 
              while the thought process of understanding what someone has just told you and how this applies to your life.<br> For example, just because someone tells you to do something does not mean you immediately follow through with this task. 
              There is a time for your mind to process if this makes sense and will benefit or be safe to yourself. From here is where the mind communicates with the body to follow through with this action on the physical side. 
              This acts as a safety pillow for many people out there that tend to speak without speaking</p>
