      <p>Inversion has been studied my philosopher for thousands of years. As many saw it as a new way to see percieve things around us. As many had 
        discussed a way of preparing your head for the worst to come ahead of time would help them overcome their fears and 
        in other situations be able to prepare your life and adjust much more easily.</p>
        <p> This way of thinking, in which you consider the opposite of what you want, 
          is known as inversion. When I first learned of it, I didn't realize how powerful it could be. 
          As I have studied it more, I have begun to realize that inversion is a rare and crucial skill 
          that nearly all great thinkers use to their advantage.</p>
          <p> While the old Sigmund Freud had researched and spent most of his life studying was "Freud believes that events in our childhood can have a significant impact on our behavior as adults. He also believed that people have little free will to make choices in life. Instead, our behavior is determined by the unconscious mind and childhood experiences.

         <p>Freud’s psychoanalysis is both a theory and therapy. It is the original psychodynamic theory and inspired psychologists such as Jung and Erikson to develop their own psychodynamic theories. Freud’s work is vast, and he has contributed greatly to psychology as a discipline.  Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, explained the human mind as like an iceberg, with only a small amount of it being visible, that is our observable behavior, but it is the unconscious, submerged mind that has the most, underlying influence on our behavior. Freud used three main methods of accessing the unconscious mind: free association, dream analysis and slips of the tongue. 
          
          He believed that the unconscious mind consisted of three components: the 'id' the 'ego' and the 'superego.'  The 'id' contains two main instincts: 'Eros', which is the life instinct, which involves self-preservation and sex which is fuelled by the 'libido' energy force. 'Thanatos' is the death instinct, whose energies, because they are less powerful than those of 'Eros' are channeled away from ourselves and into aggression towards others.</p>
